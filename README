Write a brief description of the program above and give it a suitable name that reflects its function.

The program above is designed to scrape email addresses from a website and save them to a text file while also ensuring that duplicate email addresses are not added to the list. The program starts by connecting to the specified website and using regular expressions to search for email addresses in the HTML content. It then searches for all links on the page and visits each link that contains "firma.php". For each of these pages, it also searches for email addresses and adds them to the email list if they are not already present. Finally, the program writes all the email addresses to a text file named "emails.txt". A suitable name for this program might be "EmailScraper".
